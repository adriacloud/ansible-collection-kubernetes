# Ansible collection for Kubernetes

This is a forked version of [`vexxhost.kubernetes`](https://github.com/vexxhost/ansible-collection-kubernetes)
collection which is intended to be agnostic from Atmosphere implementation
and contain playbooks and roles to deploy a generic Kubernetes cluster using Ansible.
